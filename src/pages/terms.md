# Terms of the service

## Brief notice
In this document, I Edvinas Momkus edvinasmomkus@gmail.com in simple terms explain that this site does not execute mallicious code.
Main concern is using oAuth.
Second I am able to see the info of your device details that your browser provides.
Third, the data that you enter when interacting with the app.
I will never sell your data, nor disclose to 3rd parties. The oAuth does not grant me access to your emails, service settings, etc.. I only get your email address, name, picture.
It is not a commertial oriented app, just a research.

## Data Colection

The input data is in cloudflare's D1 database on my account there.
The files are stored on cloudflare's S2 buckets.
Connection context does provide me ip address, which I reference for connection quota limits, and session logic. 

### Store durration

I store data temporary, or indefinetly. If I am contacted and requested for your input data to be deleted, I will comply.

## Cookies

The source app use few cookies once oAuth is completed. These cookies are identity only.
Besides source, cloudflare's engine use their own cookies.
I have no contracts with no services to set your browser agent any cookies.
